# maximum likelihood estimation of theta using newton's method

I write these codes for my assignment.

Project requirements:
1. to estimate theta with known item parameters (2PLM);
2. to compute bias and RMSE for estimated theta and true theta;
3. given the following files:
   response_matrix.txt;
   theta_parameter.txt;
   item_parameter.txt.

The project framework:
1. define function1: Newton-Raphson method of theta estimation for 2PLM
   (with the implement of downhill algorithm)
2. define function2: Grid-Search method of theta estimation for 2PLM
   (an option for the estimation of score of 0 or full scores)
3. the estimation main body
   (with boundary manipulation)
4. plot estimate theta results: 
   a scatterplot & a density plot
5. save results
6. return bias, RMSE and timecost to the console

You can use these codes to estimate your own theta with your a and b parameters!
Also, feel free to ask me any question.
